# Support

HNSDNS offers support for free. We just ask you to follow these simple guidelines, to provide a better support experience for everyone:

!!! tip "Guidelines for contacting support"

    * Please don't spam. Even though you can send unlimited messages through the chat, please note that we don't get paid for the service.
    * Please be respectful. We try to provide the best service we can. If you don't like HNSDNS, just stop using it, it's not mandatory.
    * Please be patient. We can only answer your messages a few hours every day. It may take some time before we get into your question.
    * Please don't ask us to add a significant amount of content to the docs. Do it by yourself through GitHub.
    * Please do not send two messages, unless you sent the second one by mistake, which you should aknowledge that in the chat. We never lose messages.

We offer support via chat and email. 

## Chat support

We use Drift to provide the chat service. It's the fastest way to get in touch with us, and you can even decide wether provide an email address (highly recommended) or not.

You can open our chat widget by clicking on the button below:

[:material-chat-plus: Open chat](javascript:openChat();){ .md-button }

After clicking the button, a new widget should appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Click on it, accept the privacy policy and send a message to us.

## Email support

You can send an email to us through the following email address:

!!! info "Replace (~at-] with @ and {/d0t\\) with a period. This is used to prevent bots spamming the email address."

    support (~at-] hnsdns {/d0t\\) com

Email support is suggested if you want to add a more extensive content to the message's body, or you want to sent screenshots, images, files and more. However, it isn't as practical as chat support.

Guidelines also apply to email support.
